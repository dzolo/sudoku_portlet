This application represents a portlet implementation of the Sudoku game.

== Description ==

The application was developed for Red Hat company as an examplary portlet that
demonstrates how portlets may be developed with a usage of REST and AJAX
technologies.

Details and the description may be found in bachelor's thesis of the author [1]
and in the user manual. The user manual is attached to this app in a form
of the PDF file on the path: `/user-manual-1.0.pdf`.

== Installation ==

The application may be built and deployed using the Apache Maven [2].
The supported portals and deployment environments are:

 * GateIn 3.2.0 with JBoss AS 5.1.0
 * GateIn 3.2.0 with JBoss AS 6.0.0
 * GateIn 3.2.0.Final with Tomcat 6
 * GateIn 3.2.0.Final with Tomcat 7
 * JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.0

The application may be deployed automatically using the NetBeans IDE [3] or 
manually from the CLI as shown below:

* Instruction for the JBoss AS (5.1/6) or JBoss EPP:

1) Move to a directory of the application on your system.

3) Build and deploy the application.

 $ mvn clean package jboss:hard-deploy -P "jboss-as" \
        -Denv.JBOSS_HOME=<path-to-your-JBoss-AS-home-dir>

* Instruction for the Tomcat 5 <=:

1) Move to a directory of the application on your system.

3) Build and deploy the application. An account must be specified in the
   tomcat-users.xml and the specified user must belong to the manager-gui role.

 $ mvn clean package tomcat:deploy -P "tomcat" \
        -Dtomcat.url=http://localhost:8080/manager \
        -Dtomcat.path=/sudoku-game \
        -Dtomcat.user=<username> \
        -Dtomcat.password=<password>

* Instruction for the Tomcat 5 >:

1) Move to a directory of the application on your system.

3) Build and deploy the application. An account must be specified in the
   tomcat-users.xml and the specified user must belong to the manager-script role.

 $ mvn clean package tomcat:deploy -P "tomcat" \
        -Dtomcat.url=http://localhost:8080/manager/text \
        -Dtomcat.path=/sudoku-game \
        -Dtomcat.user=<username> \
        -Dtomcat.password=<password>

== Configuration ==

All configuration actions have to be done before the installation.

* The database connection may be configured in the `persistence.xml` file, 
  located: `/src/main/resources/persistence.xml`. If the JBoss AS is used
  the database resource may be changed within the `/src/main/jboss-ds-xml`
  file. On the other hand if the Tomcat is used, the configuration is located:
  `/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml`

* If the JBoss AS is used the path of the application on the application server
  may be changed within the `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml` file.
  On the other hand if the Tomcat is used, the path may be changed
  in installation parameters.

* Skins of the game board may be configured in the `sudoku-portlet-skins.xml`
  file, located: `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/sudoku-portlet-skins.xml` 

* Drivers of remote periodical services may be configured in the
  `sudoku-portlet-periodical-service-drivers.xml` file, located:
  `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/sudoku-portlet-periodical-service-drivers.xml`

* Periodically remote services may be disabled in the remotePublishersEnabled
  init parameter of the portlet deployment descriptor, located:
  `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/portlet.xml`
